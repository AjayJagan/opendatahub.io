  - title: Open Data Hub 0.7 - end of June 2020
    children:
    - title: KF 1.0 on OpenShift
      description: The main goal of this initiative is to verify Kubeflow 1.0 works on OpenShift and fix the issues we find. Another goal is to document and ideally automate some of the verification process to start enabling the CI for KF on OpenSHift.
    - title: CI improvements
      description: Extending tests for all components, enabling CI for the operator repository.
    - title: Mixing ODH & KF components (start)
